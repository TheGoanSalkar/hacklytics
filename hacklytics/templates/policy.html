            <h2>Basic Insurance Terms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Actual cash value:</strong> Cost of replacing damaged or destroyed property with comparable new property, minus depreciation and obsolescence. For example, a 10-year-old sofa will not be replaced at the current full value because of value depreciation.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjuster:</strong> A person who investigates claims and recommends settlement options based on estimates of damage and insurance policies held.</li>
                <li><strong>Agent:</strong> The person who sells and services insurance policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Carrier:</strong> The company that underwrites the policy (i.e., is responsible for paying claims covered by the policy).</li>
                <li><strong>Claim:</strong> A demand made by the insured, or the insured's beneficiary, for payment of the benefits as outlined by the policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Coinsurance:</strong> Property insurance requires policyholders to carry coinsurance — insurance equal to a specified percentage of the value of property — in order to be eligible for full payment on a loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> The scope of protection provided under an insurance policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Deductible:</strong> Amount of loss that the insured pays before the insurance kicks in.</li>
                <li><strong>Endorsement:</strong> An amendment or addition to an existing policy that changes the term or scope of the policy. It’s sometimes called a “rider.”</li>
                <li><strong>Indemnity:</strong> Restoration to the victim by payment, repair, or replacement.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy:</strong> The written contract stating the conditions of your insurance coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Qualifying event:</strong> An occurrence that triggers an insured’s protection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Disasters Covered by Homeowners Insurance</h2>
<p>Homeowners insurance typically covers the following disasters:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fire or lightning</li>
    <li>Windstorm or hail</li>
    <li>Explosion</li>
    <!-- Add the rest of the perils as list items -->
</ul>

<h2>Homeowners Insurance Policy Options</h2>


<h3>Policy 1 (HO-1 Basic Form)</h3>
<p>A basic policy providing limited coverage for specific perils.</p>

<h3>Policy 2 (HO-3 Special Form)</h3>
<p>The most common policy type offering broad coverage for the home, personal belongings, and liability.</p>


<h3>Policy 3 (HO-8 )</h3>
<p>This policy is tailored for older homes with a replacement cost that may far exceed the market value. It's ideal for historic homes and landmarks, providing coverage that recognizes the unique value and replacement considerations of such properties.</p>
