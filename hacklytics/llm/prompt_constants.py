FIRE_TEXT = "A home was completely destroyed in a fire"

FIRE_ANSWER = '''
Immediate Issues : Fire damage can create safety hazards such as exposed electric wiring, leaking gas lines and weakened support beams. These hazards can lead to secondary fires, explosions or injuries if not addressed promptly. The residue from smoke and soot can be hazardous to health, causing respiratory issues and other health problems. Proper cleanup and ventilation are necessary to mitigate these risks. The fire can compromise the structural integrity of the building, making it unsafe for anyone to enter. Walls, floors, and roofs may collapse, posing a significant risk to anyone attempting to enter the premises.

Immediate Fixes : Isolate the affected areas to prevent access by unauthorized individuals and contain any potential leaks or hazards. Engage a qualified electrician to assess the condition of the electrical system, repair any exposed wiring or damaged circuits, and ensure compliance with safety standards.  Document all inspections, repairs, and compliance measures undertaken to address safety hazards. Ensure that all work meets relevant building codes, regulations, and safety standards.

Long-term Issues : Firefighting efforts often involve significant amounts of water, which can cause water damage to the property and its contents. Mold growth can occur rapidly in damp environments, posing additional health risks.  Even if the structure initially appears stable, hidden damage from the fire could emerge over time. Weakening of structural components due to heat exposure may become more apparent, necessitating extensive repairs or even demolition and reconstruction.

Long-term Fixes : Engage a structural engineer or qualified professional to assess the extent of the damage.  Implement temporary stabilization measures to prevent further deterioration or collapse. Replace damaged or compromised structural components with new materials that meet building code requirements and engineering specifications.  Implement preventive measures to reduce the risk of future structural damage, such as improving fire resistance through the use of fire-resistant materials, upgrading fire detection and suppression systems, and implementing fire safety protocols. Remove standing water using pumps, wet-dry vacuums, or other extraction equipment. Prompt removal of water helps prevent further damage and reduces the risk of mold growth.  Consider hiring professional water damage restoration specialists who have the expertise, equipment, and resources to effectively mitigate water damage and prevent mold growth. They can provide thorough assessment, cleanup, and restoration services tailored to your specific situation. Keep detailed records and documentation of water damage, cleanup efforts, and restoration activities for insurance purposes.

TORNADO_TEXT = "A home's roof got removed because of tornado"

TORNADO_ANSWER = '''
Immediate Issues : Tornadoes can cause severe damage to the interior of homes, leading to immediate safety hazards. Walls, floors, and ceilings may be compromised, posing a risk of collapse. Loose debris such as broken glass, sharp objects, and exposed wires can cause injuries if not properly addressed. The strong winds can also damage electrical systems, leading to potential electrical fires or electrocution hazards. Additionally, water damage from heavy rain or flooding that accompanies tornadoes can further worsen the structural integrity of the home and create conditions for mold growth.

Immediate Fixes : It is crucial to prioritize safety after a tornado. Ensure that the affected area is restricted to prevent unauthorized access, especially to areas with potential electrical hazards. Engage a qualified electrician to assess and repair any electrical damage, including exposed wires and damaged circuits. Install temporary supports or bracing to reinforce weakened structures and prevent further collapse. Conduct a thorough inspection of the area to identify and remove any debris, including sharp objects, glass, and fallen ceiling materials. Address any water damage promptly by removing standing water, drying out the affected area, and implementing measures to prevent mold growth.

Long-term Issues : Tornadoes can cause long-term issues that require comprehensive repairs and restoration. The impacts of the tornado may extend beyond the visible damage, such as compromised insulation, hidden structural damage, or weakened foundation. These issues can affect the safety, energy efficiency, and structural stability of the home. Mold growth can also become a concern if the water damage is not adequately addressed. Additionally, the emotional toll and displacement caused by the tornado can have long-term effects on homeowners.

Long-term Fixes : Engage a professional structural engineer or contractor to assess the extent of the damage and develop a comprehensive repair plan. Address any hidden structural damage and reinforce weakened areas to ensure the stability and safety of the home. Replace damaged insulation, drywall, and flooring to restore the functionality and aesthetics of the interior. Implement preventive measures such as storm-resistant windows, reinforced roofing materials, and secure entryways to minimize future damage from tornadoes or severe weather events. Work with water damage restoration specialists to thoroughly dry out the affected areas and mitigate the risk of mold growth. Document all repairs, assessments, and restoration activities for insurance and future reference. Seek emotional support and counseling services to address the psychological impact of the tornado on homeowners and their families.

FLOOD_ANSWER = '''
Immediate Issues : Floodwaters can cause extensive water damage to walls, floors, ceilings, and electrical systems. Floodwaters create a conducive environment for mold growth, which can pose serious health risks. Floodwaters can carry contaminants such as sewage, chemicals, and bacteria into the house, posing health hazards.

Immediate Fixes :  Immediate steps include removing standing water, drying out the affected areas, and replacing or repairing damaged materials such as drywall, flooring, and electrical components. Thoroughly clean and disinfect the affected areas using specialized cleaning agents and equipment to prevent mold growth. 

Long-term Issues : Flood damage to the foundation can lead to long-term structural issues, such as settling or sinking. Even after immediate cleanup efforts, residual moisture can lead to ongoing mold problems if not properly addressed. Floodwaters can damage electrical wiring and components, posing fire and electrocution hazards.

Long-term Fixes : Reinforce the foundation, install drainage systems to prevent future flooding, and elevate the structure if necessary. Improve ventilation, using dehumidifiers to maintain optimal humidity levels, and regularly inspect for signs of mold growth. To mitigate the risk of future flood damage, homeowners can implement long-term flood resilience measures such as installing flood barriers, elevating utilities and appliances, and landscaping to redirect water away from the house.

FLOOD_TEXT = 'A house is destroyed by floods'

TREE_TEXT = 'A house is destroyed by large tree falling into it'

TREE_ANSWER = '''
Immediate Issues : The impact of a large tree can cause significant structural damage, compromising the integrity of load-bearing walls, floors, and the roof.  The tree may have punctured or torn through the roof, leading to water infiltration and potential interior damage. Clearing the fallen tree and debris from the house is essential for safety and assessment of the full extent of the damage.

Immediate Fixes :  Immediate action involves securing the structure to prevent further collapse. Tarping or boarding up exposed areas can temporarily prevent further water damage until permanent repairs can be made. 

Long-term Issues :  If water has infiltrated the house, there is a risk of mold growth and structural decay over time. Proper repair or replacement of the damaged roof is essential to prevent further water intrusion and maintain the integrity of the structure.

Long-term Fixes : Thoroughly drying out the affected areas, removing mold-infested materials, and treating surfaces with mold inhibitors are necessary to prevent health hazards and further deterioration. Evaluating the surrounding landscape for potential hazards, such as unstable trees or soil erosion, is crucial to prevent similar incidents in the future. Tree removal or trimming, along with implementing erosion control measures, can reduce the risk of future damage to the house.
