FIRE_ANSWER = '''
Immediate Issues : Fire damage can create safety hazards such as exposed electric wiring, leaking gas lines and weakened support beams. These hazards can lead to secondary fires, explosions or injuries if not addressed promptly. The residue from smoke and soot can be hazardous to health, causing respiratory issues and other health problems. Proper cleanup and ventilation are necessary to mitigate these risks. The fire can compromise the structural integrity of the building, making it unsafe for anyone to enter. Walls, floors, and roofs may collapse, posing a significant risk to anyone attempting to enter the premises.

Immediate Fixes : Isolate the affected areas to prevent access by unauthorized individuals and contain any potential leaks or hazards. Engage a qualified electrician to assess the condition of the electrical system, repair any exposed wiring or damaged circuits, and ensure compliance with safety standards.  Document all inspections, repairs, and compliance measures undertaken to address safety hazards. Ensure that all work meets relevant building codes, regulations, and safety standards.

Long-term Issues : Firefighting efforts often involve significant amounts of water, which can cause water damage to the property and its contents. Mold growth can occur rapidly in damp environments, posing additional health risks.  Even if the structure initially appears stable, hidden damage from the fire could emerge over time. Weakening of structural components due to heat exposure may become more apparent, necessitating extensive repairs or even demolition and reconstruction.

Long-term Fixes : Engage a structural engineer or qualified professional to assess the extent of the damage.  Implement temporary stabilization measures to prevent further deterioration or collapse. Replace damaged or compromised structural components with new materials that meet building code requirements and engineering specifications.  Implement preventive measures to reduce the risk of future structural damage, such as improving fire resistance through the use of fire-resistant materials, upgrading fire detection and suppression systems, and implementing fire safety protocols. Remove standing water using pumps, wet-dry vacuums, or other extraction equipment. Prompt removal of water helps prevent further damage and reduces the risk of mold growth.  Consider hiring professional water damage restoration specialists who have the expertise, equipment, and resources to effectively mitigate water damage and prevent mold growth. They can provide thorough assessment, cleanup, and restoration services tailored to your specific situation. Keep detailed records and documentation of water damage, cleanup efforts, and restoration activities for insurance purposes.
